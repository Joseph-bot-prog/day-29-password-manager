Day-29

Take a break, only if needed. Today's topics was Password Manager using Tkinter in python, which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu.

What did I learn?

Using canvas the right way to scale the widgets.
Using columnspan to use more than 1 column to expand the widget.
Standard Dialogues in Tkinter which help in prompts, error and warning message.

Project of the day

Password Manager using Tkinter package. You can checkout my code. You can also clone and run on local machine using an IDE.

Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
